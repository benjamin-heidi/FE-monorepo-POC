# Design System Integration Summary

## Overview
Successfully integrated the `@heidi/design-system` package into both `scribe-web` and `scribe-plugins` applications with proper Tailwind CSS configuration.

## Changes Made

### 1. Tailwind Configuration Updates

#### scribe-web (`apps/scribe-web/tailwind.config.ts`)
Added design-system source files to the content array:
```typescript
content: [
  './pages/**/*.{ts,tsx}',
  './components/**/*.{ts,tsx}',
  './app/**/*.{ts,tsx}',
  './src/**/*.{ts,tsx}',
  '../../packages/design-system/src/**/*.{ts,tsx}', // Added
],
```

#### scribe-plugins (`apps/scribe-plugins/plugin/tailwind.config.ts`)
Added design-system source files to the content array:
```typescript
content: [
  './src/**/*.{ts,tsx}',
  '../../../packages/design-system/src/**/*.{ts,tsx}', // Added
],
```

### 2. Component Usage Examples

#### scribe-web (`apps/scribe-web/src/pages/play.tsx`)
Enhanced the playground page to showcase all design-system components:
- Button variants: primary, secondary, outline, ghost
- Button sizes: sm, md, lg
- Card components with different padding options
- Organized in a clear, demonstrative layout

#### scribe-plugins (`apps/scribe-plugins/plugin/src/app.tsx`)
Added a minimal, non-intrusive test component:
- Only visible in development mode (`!process.env.IS_PRODUCTION`)
- Displays in the bottom-right corner using fixed positioning
- Shows primary and secondary button variants
- Contained within a Card component for visual verification

### 3. Design System Package

#### Built the package
```bash
cd packages/design-system
pnpm build
```

Generated output:
- `dist/index.js` (ESM)
- `dist/index.cjs` (CommonJS)
- `dist/index.d.ts` (TypeScript declarations)
- `dist/index.d.cts` (CommonJS TypeScript declarations)

#### Updated README.md
Added comprehensive Tailwind configuration documentation explaining:
- Why consuming apps need to include design-system in their Tailwind content paths
- How to configure Tailwind for both scribe-web and scribe-plugins
- Proper import usage examples

### 4. Workspace Dependencies
Ran `pnpm install` at the monorepo root to ensure proper workspace linking between:
- `@heidi/design-system` → `scribe-web`
- `@heidi/design-system` → `scribe-plugins`

## Why Tailwind Classes Work Now

The design-system components use Tailwind utility classes (e.g., `bg-blue-600`, `text-white`, `hover:bg-blue-700`). These classes are defined by:
1. Each consuming app's Tailwind installation
2. The consuming app's Tailwind config scanning the design-system source files
3. Generating CSS that includes all classes used in both the app AND the design-system

This approach:
- ✅ Avoids duplicate Tailwind CSS builds
- ✅ Leverages each app's existing Tailwind setup
- ✅ Allows apps to customize their Tailwind config independently
- ✅ Standard pattern for monorepo design systems

## Development Workflow

### Hot Reload / Watch Mode

To get hot reload when editing design-system components, you **must** run the design-system in watch mode alongside your app:

**Option 1: Use the Combined Scripts (Recommended)**
```bash
# For scribe-web development with design-system hot reload
pnpm dev:web-with-ds

# For scribe-plugins development with design-system hot reload
pnpm dev:widget-with-ds
```

**Option 2: Manual (Two Terminals)**
```bash
# Terminal 1 - Design System Watch Mode
pnpm dev:design-system

# Terminal 2 - Your App
pnpm dev:web  # or dev:widget
```

**What happens:**
- Design-system rebuilds instantly (~50ms) when you change components
- Your app picks up the changes and hot reloads
- Full TypeScript support with updated type definitions

## Testing

### Test in scribe-web
1. Run: `pnpm dev:web-with-ds`
2. Navigate to `/play` route
3. You should see:
   - Button components in all variants and sizes
   - Card components with different padding options
   - Audio visualizer (existing component)
4. Edit `packages/design-system/src/components/Button.tsx` and see live updates!

### Test in scribe-plugins
1. Run: `pnpm dev:widget-with-ds`
2. Look for the test card in the bottom-right corner showing:
   - Primary and Secondary buttons
   - Card container with title
3. Edit components and see live updates!

## Files Modified

1. `apps/scribe-web/tailwind.config.ts` - Added design-system to content paths
2. `apps/scribe-web/src/pages/play.tsx` - Added component showcase
3. `apps/scribe-plugins/plugin/tailwind.config.ts` - Added design-system to content paths
4. `apps/scribe-plugins/plugin/src/app.tsx` - Added dev-only test component
5. `packages/design-system/README.md` - Added Tailwind configuration documentation
6. `packages/design-system/dist/*` - Built package output (4 files)

## Next Steps

- ✅ Design system components are ready to use in both apps
- ✅ Tailwind classes are properly scanned and generated
- ✅ Development and production builds will work correctly
- Consider adding more components to the design system as needed
- Consider adding Storybook for component documentation (optional)
